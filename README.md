# RSYWX API in Lumen

I have always been using [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) to create [RSYWX](https://rsywx.net) API. 

Since Slim 4, the overall structure has been **TOTALLY** different from previous version, which makes me think that it may be too much for a personal API provider. 

So I switched to [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/). I may want to switch my main RSYWX site to Laravel as well in the future, but no solid plan yet.
